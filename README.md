# -project-conditional-text-generation-and-augmentation-for-sentiment-classification
A novel approach to handle class imbalance by using conditional text generation to synthesize minority-class samples. This enriches training data, improves representation of rare classes, and leads to better classification performance, robustness, and overall evaluation metrics.
